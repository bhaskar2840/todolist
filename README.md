# todolist

I tried using ejs to create a website using template.
we created a view folder in order to use the ejs commands and created an ejs file list.ejs for all our ejs codes.


```javascript
// code away!

// jshint esversion:6

const express=require("express");

const app=express();



app.set("view engine","ejs"); // this is to include the ejs folder named view and use the ejs file. 
```
