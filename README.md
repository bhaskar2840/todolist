# todolist

I tried using ejs to create a website using template.
we created a view folder in order to use the ejs commands and created an ejs file list.ejs for all our ejs codes.


```javascript
// code away!

let generateProject = project => {
  let code = [];
  for (let js = 0; js < project.length; js++) {
    code.push(js);
  }
};
```
